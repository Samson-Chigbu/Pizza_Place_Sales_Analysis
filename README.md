# üçï Pizza Place Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on a dataset of pizza sales. The goal of this analysis is to transform raw sales, orders, and product information into actionable business insights. The entire analysis, including data merging, cleaning, transformation, and visualization, is contained within the included Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Analysis & Findings

The analysis addresses critical business questions and provides visualized insights, including:

* **Revenue Performance:** Calculation of total annual revenue, average order value, and daily revenue trends.
* **Peak Demand:** Identification of peak sales hours, days of the week, and months to optimize staffing and inventory.
* **Best/Worst Sellers:** Determining the **Top 10 Bestselling Pizzas** by quantity sold.
* **Category & Size Metrics:** Analyzing **revenue distribution by pizza category** (e.g., Classic, Veggie) and the distribution of **sales by pizza size** (S, M, L).
* **Data Preparation:** The project demonstrates robust data merging techniques, combining four separate datasets (`pizzas.csv`, `orders.csv`, `order_details.csv`, and `pizza_types.csv`) to create a unified view for analysis.

## Technologies Used

The project is built entirely in Python and relies on the following libraries:

* **Python**
* **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
* **Matplotlib:** Used for generating all data visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The primary environment for executing the analysis.
